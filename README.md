# website_monitoring
Python code for website monitoring and alerting with Prometheus
This code performs website monitoring and alerting with Prometheus, a popular monitoring and time-series database solution.
The prometheus_client library is imported, and a Summary metric called REQUEST_TIME is defined to measure the processing time of requests.
The check_website() function is updated to measure the processing time using the time module and observe the value using the REQUEST_TIME metric.
The Prometheus metrics server is started on port 8000 using start_http_server(8000).
During each iteration, the websites are monitored, and if an exception occurs, it is logged and the remediate_issue() function is called.
The script sleeps for 60 seconds between each iteration.
Prometheus scrapes the /metrics endpoint exposed by the script to collect and store the metrics data. Alerting rules are configured based on these metrics and notify you of any anomalies or issues.
